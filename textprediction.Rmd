# TO DO


1. DO FREQ STUDIES OF WORDS.
2. FREQ OF 2-NGRAM
3. EVALUATE WORDS ON FOREIGN LANG
4. WORDS IN A CORPUS. coverage with dictionary.

### Introduction


### Preprocess the Corpus
    unicode?
    split files test-case. X%


### Describe the Corpus

    words in lower.
    count lines, words per file.
    unique words.
    symbols.
    numbers.
    
    
### Building the data structures

1 only punctuation is appostrophe (contractions)
2 avoid other thing than words. problematic and difficult to predict.
3 wrong language (do nothing)
4 no-profanity filtering. left up-to the last phase of text-prediction. (ie. replace profanity with "!@%#&!")
5 typos. forget.
6 low-up cases. all lower. left up-to the last phase. (ie. after a '.' capital)

    don't reset n-grams on full stops or newlines.

    4-gram 3-gram 2-gram
    tables
    charts


### Describe the app

user interface.


### Describe the algorithm

7 relay on n-grams.

4-gram backoff. coverage depending on available memory.

5. INCREASE COVERAGE.
    via 

map words to integer values to compress usage. (calculate how much)
